Pacman with Tux
===
A re-creation of the popular arcade game, [Pac-Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man) that was developed by [Namco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namco).

The player controls Pac-Man through a maze of various dots, known as Pac-Dots, as well as four multi-colored ghosts: Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. The goal of the game is to consume all the Pac-Dots in a stage in order to proceed to the next one. Between some stages, one of three intermission animations plays. The four ghosts roam the maze, trying to kill Pac-Man. If any of the ghosts touch Pac-Man, he loses a life; when all lives have been lost, the game ends.

---

A simple game made after attending my first CS class, COMP10110 Computer Programming I. I was inspired by the idea that my professor used pac-man as a way to illustrate an object going from s(source) to d(destination). He wrote simple C code for the object to automatically find its way from s to d while I will do that and also make it a playable game by writing everything in Python.

<a href="choosing_a_text_editor"></a>Python IDE or Text Editors
---
There are many Python IDE or text editors to choose from, ultimately, which to use is subjective, so choose the one that suits you.

Personally, I prefer Geany for Python. You can also download their plugins which support a wide range of functions that you may find useful.

- [Downloading and using Geany-plugins](https://plugins.geany.org/downloads.html)

If you are using Geany. Open run_game.py and press F5.

For other IDEs, just execute the run_game.py
